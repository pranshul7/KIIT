This folder contains all the coding assignments done by me during labs in the course CS 1093 - Computer Programming (in C), in my first semester of B.Tech. undergraduate studies at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, India.

The assignments are organised in folders, named corresponding to the day the assignments were done. The naming convention used for the folders is - YY_MM_DD, where YY is the last two digits of the year, MM is the month and DD is the date.

Following is a short indexing of the folders/day and the corresponding topics of the questions done on that day:
