Q2] Assign a number to an int variable. Then display all four groups of 8-8 bits (out of total 32 bits) separately in decimal and hexadecimal form.

Q3] Assign a number to an unsigned char variable.Then interchange the left 4 bits and right 4 bits of the 8-bit binary value of that number.then display the value of the new 8-bit binary value obtained, in decimal and hexadecimal.

Q4] Assign a number to an int variable. Then interchange 2nd group of 8 bits from left hand side and 2nd group of 8 bits from right hand side. Then display the new number formed in decimal and hexadecimal form.
